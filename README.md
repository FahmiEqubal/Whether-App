# About Me

Hello, I'm Equbal Fahmi, a frontend developer passionate about creating web applications that provide valuable information at your fingertips. I'm excited to introduce you to one of my recent projects:

## Project: Weather App

https://fahmiequbal.github.io/Whether-App/

### Overview

I've designed a Weather App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This user-friendly web application empowers users to access real-time weather information by searching for a city by name. Key features of the project include:

- **City-Based Weather**: Users can enter the name of a city, and the app fetches and displays the current weather conditions for that location.

- **Visual Weather Data**: The app provides users with clear and visually appealing weather data, including temperature, conditions, and more.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application boasts an intuitive and clean user interface, making it easy for users to search for weather information.

- **Responsive Design**: The app is optimized for various devices, ensuring accessibility on both desktop and mobile platforms.
